Meeting #1:
- liked Liam's code along

intro discussion (10-15 minutes)
- tie in concepts from previous weeks regarding importance of encryption
- facilitate discussion about why ciphers are necessary, how they came to be, the history, etc
- how would you pass along a confidential message to someone else?
- methods of decryption (sampling frequencies of different letters - giving them text to decrypt?)

brief overview of each cipher (5 mins each --> 15 mins total)
- enigma machine is example of polyalphabetic cipher + Alan Turing connection (levels exist for how complicated you want to encryption can be -- programming assignment?!)

code alongs for ciphers (15 mins each --> 30 mins total)
- breakout room to whiteboard algorithm for caesar cipher
- hw can be to write decryption of caesar cipher? (mild challenge - give key; spicy challenge - guess the key)



Meeting #2:
async: non-coding piece
- research a time in history or current events where ciphers were used (ex: Navajo during WWII) & how you can bring it into the classroom

homework: 
- mild: decrypting caesar cipher
- medium: decrypting vigenere
- caliente: enigma machine
- habanero: ???

TO DO: post slides at beginning of session & create one-pager for async&hw

- Jiyoon - vigenere
- Eduardo - intro & substitution
- Tiffany - caesar
